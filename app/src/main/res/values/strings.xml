    <string name="instructions_color">When you click next, you will be taken to a review page. You will see multiple bars that will give you an insight of the patient in the labeled aspect. It is color coded. In most cases, it will either be green or red, which means the score is past the cut off. But in some cases it can be orange, where there are 2 cut-offs. See below for more details on what it means.</string>
